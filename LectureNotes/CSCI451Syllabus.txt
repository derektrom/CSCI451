GENERAL:

1) Exams will only be given at the scheduled times unless prior arrangements
   have been made.

2) Regular attendance is expected and students are responsible for any/all
   material covered in class.

3) All assignments are due on the assigned dates (by midnight). No
   late assignments are accepted without PRIOR written approval.

4) Grading: 3 exams,      100 points each.
            Homework,     10+ points each.
	      Quizes,     5   points each.

            A=100-90%, B=89-80%, C=79-70%, D=69-60%, F=59-0%.

5) Plagiarism: You are expected to write your own assignments. In any/all cases
   of plagiarism the grade for that assignment will be zero for all persons
   involved. However, I do encourage students to discuss and work together on
   labs and assignments. But, do not copy solutions, programs, or code fragments
   from other students. All cases of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of
   students.

COVID-19 Info:
All members of the University community have a role in creating and maintaining a COVID-19 resilient campus.  There are several expectations that all community members, including students, are asked to follow for the safety of all:  maintain physical distancing of at least 6 feet while in UND facilities, wear face coverings during interactions with others and in the classroom, wash their hands often and use hand sanitizer, properly clean spaces that they utilize, and if experiencing any symptoms, stay home and call their health care provider. Students electing not to comply with any of the COVID related requirements will not be permitted in the classroom, and may be subject to disciplinary action. We encourage all members of the University community choose to model positive behavior both on- and off-campus.

Information regarding the pandemic and UND’s efforts to create a COVID resilient campus is available on the COVID-19 blog (http://blogs.und.edu/coronavirus/). Please subscribe to stay up to date on COVID related information.

Students who test positive for COVID-19 or are identified as a close contact are expected to immediately self-isolate/quarantine. If you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been placed in quarantine due to being identified as a close contact or travel we strongly recommend that you report the information to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities at 701.777.2664 or online at https://veoci.com/veoci/p/w/ss2x4cq9238u. Doing so will ensure students have the support they need to continue with their academic goals and to protect others.
