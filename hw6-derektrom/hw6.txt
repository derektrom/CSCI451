HW-6	CS451	10 points	Due: Monday, 10/12/2020

Modify your HW5 such that thread 2 unexpectidly exits 
and unexpectidly dies. You can do this by modifying the 
hw5-2.in file as follows:

SAMPLE hw5-2:
-------------
1
2
3
4
5
& <--- note this added symbol
6
7
8

Case 1 unexpectidly exits:
--------------------------
Upon encountering the & symbol, have your thread IMMEDIATELY 
do a pthread_exit. Do NOT unlock any mutexs!!!!

Case 2 unexpectidly dies:
--------------------------
Upon encountering the & symbol, have your thread call system
("kill -s 9 TID") where TID is the PID of the thread (pthread_self). 
Do NOT unlock any mutexs!!!!

In both cases you need to analyze what your code did (locked up, 
kept running, etc). There is no correct answer to this as it will 
depend on how you wrote your code. What I want to see is a 1 page 
(min/max) description of what happened in both cases (maybe 1 sentence) 
and WHY it happened. I.e. how did the design of your synchronization 
mechanism result in what ever happened? This section needs to be 
the rest of the page.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your must submit a word doc (hw-6-yourname.doc) on the due date.
